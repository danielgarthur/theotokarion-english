1 S 4 1: Some versions read ικέτη (supplicant), instead of οικέτη (house-hold slave or servant).

6 M 1 4: The phrase "... and let them now weep" is probably referring to sinners, and not to the bride and bridegroom. 

8 M P 2: Bridal-chamber is repeated three times with different words in Greek (νυμφών, παστάς, θάλαμος).

8 M P 3: Some versions read ναός (temple) instead of νοός (mind), resulting in a reading of "... perfectiοn of purity, thou temple of soul and body, ...". This is probably a typo, as νοός makes more sense in this context.
