Sunday Evening

A composition of Saint Andrew of Crete

Whose acrostic is “Receive the first-fruits of our lamentation, O Maiden. Yes.”

Ode 1

O come today, my soul, and let us offer the first-fruits of lamentation unto the Theotokos. For she hath redeemed the race of man from Adam's curse, and hath bestowed the blessing and joy.

My tears, as numerous as the Jordan's streams, shall in no wise suffice to wash away the mire of my sins. But cleanse me, O Virgin, by thy compassion.

O Virgin who gavest birth to Christ the sun of righteousness that setteth not, enlighten, I pray, the eyes of my soul darkened by the mist of pleasures and fatness of sin.

Transgressing the laws of the Lord, I have performed every kind of evil. And now as Ι repent, O Lady Mary, despise me not, thy worthless slave, but having compassion, save me.

Ode 3

The serpent hath beguiled me, as once he did to Eve, and by the taste of pleasure expelled me from the paradise of divine knowledge. O Lady who gavest birth to Christ the second Adam, raise me up to life.

Suffering from the madness of Cain, O Virgin, I murdered mine own mind with the sword of lust as if it were my brother, sorely begrudging its ascent. But as thou art the friend of man, save me. 

Adam lamented in days of old, banished from Eden, the entrance blocked by Cherubim. And having fallen from divine knowledge, with tears I beg thee, O Mother of God: pray thou, with all the saints, that I may be delivered from the passions.

May the remembrance of death conduct thee, O my wretched soul, in all the deeds of life. Mingle lamentation with mourning, having a pure and blameless mediatress before Christ who sprouted forth from her.

Ode 4

How great thy wonders, O unwedded Mistress! For thou hast become a mediatress for sinners before the one born from thee. Wherefore, entreat that even I, who have sinned above all men, be reconciled with him. 

Mortify the mind of my flesh, O Virgin, and bring to naught the counsel of the demons and the onslaughts of the passions. And guide me to walk the paths of life, O thou who didst conceive the life of all.

Cleanse the defilements of my heart with tears, O pure one. And by the protection of the august Angels, cause the darkness of my soul and the wandering of my mind to be recalled and guide me toward the path of dispassion. 

I have utterly defiled my mind and soul with shameful thoughts and pleasures, surpassing those in the days of Noah with my shameful offenses. Wherefore I cry: have mercy, O Conceiver of God, and save me from the noetic flood.

Ode 5

Snatch me away from Gehenna’s cruel flame, O thou all-blameless Conceiver of God who gavest birth unto the unapproachable flame of Divinity who became like us by the theandric hypostasis.

I, the wretched one, fear not the punishments that are to come, nor the darkness, nor the gnashing of teeth and the worm, nor the unquenchable fire. Wherefore I beseech thee, O Virgin: deliver me from all these.

Heal the sufferings of my soul that I may magnify thee faithfully, O all-pure one who gavest birth unto the one who hath healed our infirmities by his all-august and saving Passions.

Unlike Lamech, I murdered not the man and youth, O Mother of God, but rather my mind and reason by my offenses. Hence, when I am judged, let not punishment be dispensed but rather cleanse me herein.

Ode 6

I have defiled my body with deeds, my mind with thoughts, and my senses with the touch of the pleasures. Grant me healing from these through the dripping of my tears, O graced of God.

The time of my life has been consumed by sleep and rest and reveling and wandering thoughts. Wherefore chasten me now, O Mother of God, if only in my old age, and lead me by the hand to repentance. 

Reflecting on the madness of those before the law, I set my hand to shameful deeds, foolishly laying one atop another like walls. Wherefore by the divine Spirit, O pure one, grant me understanding.

The truly haughty ones have laid a trap for me, O all-hymned one. And with the cords of my transgressions they have stretched out snares before my feet. O good one, melt them like a spider's web.

Kathisma

O true and steadfast hope of Christians, bestower of mercy and fountain of sympathy, the key that opens the goodness of God, open for all the gates of compassion, and grant to all, O Mistress, the entrance to the joy of Paradise.

Ode 7

Break asunder, O pure one, the bonds of my heart, the oblivion and fearful ignorance, the blindness of my soul, and the folly with which my mind, being fettered, cannot run toward the expanse of contemplation and the height of divine knowledge.

O my passions and stirrings! O my immeasurable evils! What shameful deed have I not foolishly performed? What hedonic sin have I not committed? Wherefore, O thou pure one, grant me repentance, if only in my old age.

With thy vigilance toward God, O Mistress, drive away the laziness and troublesome drowsiness in me and have compassion on me, O immaculate one, as I chant: O praised and all-glorious God of our fathers!

Woe to me, O my soul! O how thou hast disgraced thyself more than the shameless Ham! Thou hast not covered the shame of thy neighbor with nature and grace, but rather inhumanly despised him. Wherefore fervently turn back now in repentance toward the merciful Maiden.

Ode 8

O my wretched soul, which hath perished most dreadfully from neglect, awaken as if from sleep and make the Theotokos, who alone hath not known man, to be thy mediatress so that she may quicken thee by the ways of repentance and may show thee the paths of dispassion.

Calm the passionate yearnings, O Panagia, and utterly blot out the imaginations of the soul-destroying passions, O pure Mother of God, so that I may ever glorify and bless thee, the only cause of the salvation of all.

I have foolishly indulged in every possible pleasure, and I have shamefully defiled every one of my senses. O undefiled Lady and protectress of all sinners, unto thee I flee for refuge. Deliver me from the fire and eternal darkness.

With the sprinkling of my tears, O pure one, wash the sores and festering wounds of my soul, O thou who didst bear the Christ who healed the lepers and the woman with the issue of blood, so that I too may hear the longed-for voice: thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace.

Ode 9

I have already come to the end of my temporal life, O Maiden. Woe to my existence! And weighed down by sins, I depart to the endless ages to be punished. O thou who gavest birth to the Judge, cause him to be merciful unto me, O Mistress.

I, the wretched one, have rejected the laws of God and have enslaved myself to the law of sin, having not bowed down to the law of the mind. Having forgotten the laws of nature by thy august child-bearing, subject the law of my flesh.
 
Lift the heavy burden of my accusations, O all-blameless Theotokos, and account me worthy, O pure one, to bear the light yoke of thy Son and God and to travel the path that leads to the portion that is above.

So that thou mayest show the boundless depth of thy mercy and of the goodness and compassion of thy Son, O all-lauded one, grant even unto me, who have sinned above all, forgiveness and the dwelling of Paradise.

Prosomia

Rejoice, all-lauded one, thou most pure living palace of God and bearer of light. Rejoice, thou who hast not known man. Rejoice, divine shelter. Rejoice, unbreakable rampart. Rejoice, thou who hast ineffably conceived God. Rejoice, restoration of Adam and redemption Eve. Rejoice, strength of all the faithful.

Rejoice, fiery throne of God, thou unfading rose. Rejoice, thou who alone didst sprout forth the sweet-smelling lily. Rejoice, Panagia, through whom we have been redeemed from the prior judgment, O Mistress. Rejoice, all-wondrous joy of the world. Rejoice, boast of all the Orthodox.

Rejoice, immaculate one, thou lush and fragrant meadow. Rejoice, blossoming vine. Rejoice, O Virgin, thou fruitful olive tree. Rejoice, myrrh-breathing vineyard of God. Rejoice, densely-wooded and shady mountain. Rejoice, Ever-Virgin, thou pleasant garden of grace.

Fill my heart with joy, O pure one, as thou art compassionate, and set me free from tears, as one who didst give birth to joy, thou who alone art the Mother of God. And rescue me, thy servant, I pray, from all dangers, so that I may glorify and magnify thee with longing, O thou who dost surpass all beings.
